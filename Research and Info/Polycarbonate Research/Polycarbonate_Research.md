To convert metric U-Values to Imperial inch-pound U-Values, divide by 5.678. 
Example: A metric U-Value listed like the following "Standard:Uw 1.2 W / m2K," simply divide 1.2 รท 5.678 = .21  The resulting U.S. U-Value is .21

To convert inch-pound Imperial U-Values to metric U-Values, multiply by 5.678. 

To convert Imperial inch-pound R-Ralues to metric R-Values, multiply by 0.1761. One inch = 2.54 cms. One (RSI) U-factor coefficient = 5.678; one R-Value = .1761 RSI.
