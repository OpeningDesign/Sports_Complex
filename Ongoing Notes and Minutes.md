### Sports Complex - Ongoing Notes and Minutes

---

* Site

  * Site Layout to accommodate easy expansion
    * (TG) "The expansion area to the north of Phase 1 is going to be tennis courts (probably 3 will fit).  And also racquetball courts (as many as we can in the space that is left over from the tennis.  So, that leaves 4 new basketball groupings"
    * (TG) entry/reception centrally located to overall future master plan.
  * (TG) Retention pond needed most likely.
	  * (TK) conferred with Civil retention pond most likely located to the north of the site.  Site gradually slopes to northwest.
		  * see [civil plans](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Sports_Complex/blob/6439713a7f2a3f5c5742423d3ef704299aa8c7cf/Transfer/20150218_Not_Open_Source_site%20plan%20from%20Civil/15-2809%20xcel%20sport%20jeff%2011x17%20PRE%20SITE.pdf) for retention locations.
    * (TG) Design retention pond to maintain standing water.  Potentially used for 'Tough Mudder' type of events
    * ~~(TG) For future: Overall site approach to accommodate running around perimeter, along with [obstacle course](https://www.google.com/search?q=obstacle+course&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS591US591&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=avemVJj1IcSeyASuyYCYAw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=912).~~
	    * ~~Potentially not appropriate now with 3rd party clinic tenant.~~
  * Site to accommodate practice field, if possible.
  * ~~(RS) Ask CIVIL/CITY if alternatives to asphalt/curb?~~
  * (TG) site was reduced to (5.5) total acres.


* Structural 
  * (RS, AB, SU) Simple/Modular Structural Spans - minimal spans to accommodate program and future expansions
     * (RS) leaning toward pre-fabricated metal building system. On par with http://www.mbma.com/
   * (RS) structural differentiate between 1-story and 2-story spaces.
   * (RS) Looking at [Corten/Weathered](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=corten%20steel&term_meta%5B%5D=corten%7Ctyped&term_meta%5B%5D=steel%7Ctyped) steel for structural steel.

	* Research needs to be done on cost/availability, especially via metal building manufacturer (if this route is taken).
* Mechanical

  * (RS) Utilize cost effective passive/indirect heating/cooling measures.
    * (RS) looking into using polycarbonate siding for solar gains. Precedents:  https://www.pinterest.com/theoryshaw/xcel/
      * combined with large overhangs for shading.
    * ~~(RS) Use Trombe walls?~~
	    * ~~(RS)Cost an issue most likely~~
  * (RS, TK) Leaning toward locating heating/cooling units on the ground to save structural/flashing/roofing costs. Need to collaborate with MECH for overall approach.
    * (RS) Radiant Heating an option?
    * (RS) Mechanical to accommodate expansion as well.
* Architectural
 * (RS) Exposed ceilings w/ acoustical mediation --i.e. no dropped ceilings
 * (RS) stained concrete floors where appropriate.

  * Entry/Reception
	  * front desk
