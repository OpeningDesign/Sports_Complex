### Sports Complex - Ongoing Notes and Minutes







---



* Site

  * Site Layout to accommodate easy expansion

    * (TG) future (2nd phase) expansion to include ~6 basketball/volleyball courts and turf programs--that is, mostly 2-story spaces.

    * (TG) entry/reception centrally located to overall future master plan.

  * (TG) Retention pond needed most likely.
	  * (TK) conferred with Civil retention pond most likely located to the north of the site.  Site gradually slopes to northwest.

    * (TG) Design retention pond to maintain standing water.  Potentially used for 'Tough Mudder' type of events

    * (TG) For future: Overall site approach to accommodate running around perimeter, along with [obstacle course](https://www.google.com/search?q=obstacle+course&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS591US591&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=avemVJj1IcSeyASuyYCYAw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=912).

  * Site to accommodate practice field, if possible.

  * ~~(RS) Ask CIVIL/CITY if alternatives to asphalt/curb?~~
  * (TG) site was reduced to (5) total acres.


* Structural 

  * (RS, AB, SU) Simple/Modular Structural Spans - minimal spans to accommodate program and future expansions

     * (RS) leaning toward pre-fabricated metal building system. On par with http://www.mbma.com/

   * (RS) structural differentiate between 1-story and 2-story spaces.

   * (RS) Looking at [Corten/Weathered](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=corten%20steel&term_meta%5B%5D=corten%7Ctyped&term_meta%5B%5D=steel%7Ctyped) steel for structural steel.

	* Research needs to be done on cost/availability, especially via metal building manufacturer (if this route is taken).

* Mechanical

  * (RS) Utilize cost effective passive/indirect heating/cooling measures.

    * (RS) looking into using polycarbonate siding for solar gains. Precedents:  https://www.pinterest.com/theoryshaw/xcel/

      * combined with large overhangs for shading.

    * (RS) Use Trombe walls?

  * (RS, TK) Leaning toward locating heating/cooling units on the ground to save structural/flashing/roofing costs. Need to collaborate with MECH for overall approach.

    * (RS) Radiant Heating an option?

    * (RS) Mechanical to accommodate expansion as well.

* Architectural

 * (RS) Exposed ceilings w/ acoustical mediation --i.e. no dropped ceilings

 * (RS) stained concrete floors where appropriate.

 * 

* Program

  * Turf area used for indoor soccer/baseball practice when batting cage nets are retracted to ceiling.

  * (TG) Aerobics and Classrooms can be one big flexible space--movable partitions.

  * Basketball Area
	  * 25ft minimum ceiling height
	  * (TG) Net/curtain between basketball and turf area.

    * also net/curtain between running track/turf area

  * (TG) Running track doesn't have to be a specific distance.

  * (TG) Entry/Reception to accommodate apparel.

  * (TG) Soundproof golf area from rest of program.
  *   (TG) Additional 1-story space for 3rd party Clinic - size to be determined.
	  * Will be shell space for 3rd party architect to layout. 
	  * (TG) to confer with 3rd party to determine size requirements, etc.

* Budget

	* Is very very tight, at present. $50/square foot. (RS) conveyed concern with (TG:owner, TK:GC).
