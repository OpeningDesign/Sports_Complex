####In-the-Open

All of [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) projects are conducted out in the open.  That is, during the development of any one project, all team communication and content is hosted [publicly](https://github.com/OpeningDesign) (here on GitHub) and is <a href="#license">open source</a>.

Our [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides a more nuanced description of this open approach.
