### Sports Complex - Ongoing Notes and Minutes



---

* Site
  * Site Layout to accommodate easy expansion
    * (TG) future (2nd phase) expansion to include ~6 basketball/volleyball courts and turf programs--that is, mostly 2-story spaces.
    * (TG) entry/reception centrally located to overall future master plan.
  * (TG) Retention pond needed most likely.
    * (TG) Design retention pond to maintain standing water.  Potentially used for 'Tough Mudder' type of events
    * (TG) For future: Overall site approach to accommodate running around perimeter, along with [obstacle course](https://www.google.com/search?q=obstacle+course&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS591US591&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=avemVJj1IcSeyASuyYCYAw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=912).
  * Site to accommodate practice field, if possible.
  * (RS) Ask CIVIL/CITY if alternatives to asphalt/curb?
* Structural 
  * (RS, AB, SU) Simple/Modular Structural Spans - minimal spans to accommodate program and future expansions
     * (RS) leaning toward pre-fabricated metal building system. On par with http://www.mbma.com/
   * (RS) structural differentiate between 1-story and 2-story spaces.
   * (RS) Looking at [Corten/Weathered](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=corten%20steel&term_meta%5B%5D=corten%7Ctyped&term_meta%5B%5D=steel%7Ctyped) steel for structural steel.
	* Research needs to be done on cost/availability, especially via metal building manufacturer (if this route is taken).
* Mechanical
  * (RS) Utilize cost effective passive/indirect heating/cooling measures.
    * (RS) looking into using polycarbonate siding for solar gains. Precedents:  https://www.pinterest.com/theoryshaw/xcel/
      * combined with large overhangs for shading.
    * (RS) Use Trombe walls?
  * (RS, TK) Leaning toward locating heating/cooling units on the ground to save structural/flashing/roofing costs. Need to collaborate with MECH for overall approach.
    * (RS) Radiant Heating an option?
* Architectural
 * (RS) Exposed ceilings w/ acoustical mediation --i.e. no dropped ceilings
 * (RS) stained concrete floors where appropriate.
 * 
* Program
  * Turf area used for indoor soccer/baseball practice when batting cage nets are retracted to ceiling.
  * (TG) Aerobics and Classrooms can be one big flexible space--movable partitions.
  * (TG) Net/curtain between basketball and turf area.
    * also net/curtain between running track/turf area
  * (TG) Running track doesn't have to be a specific distance.
  * (TG) Entry/Reception to accommodate apparel.
  * (TG) Soundproof golf area from rest of program.
* Budget
	* Is very very tight, at present. $50/square foot. (RS) conveyed concern with (TG:owner, TK:GC).
