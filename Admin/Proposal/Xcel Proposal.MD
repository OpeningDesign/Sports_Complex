####Proposal for [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) Architecture & Engineering Services

Firstly, we would like to thank you for the opportunity to submit our proposal for Xcel’s projected sports complex.  We are excited about the project and look forward to the potential of working together.  

As we understand it, the project will include an approximate 35,000 SF sporting facility that will house the following major functions.

* Turf area with Batting Cages
* Running Track
* Basketball Court(s)
* Fitness Center
* Aerobic Area(s)/Classrooms
* Lockers/Restrooms
* Indoor Golf Simulator/Range
* Offices and various auxiliary functions

Based on similar projects, we anticipate the cost of construction ranging from ($90-150/SF) or ($3.15 to $5.25 Million)

<!--
As our [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) outlines in more detail, all the design team's (architecture and engineering) work will be conducted publicly out-in-the-open and will be open source.
-->

The following is a high-level breakdown of the scopes of services we plan on providing for your project.

   * Work with GC to further refine the construction costs.
	   * If applicable, share/coordinate plans with metal building manufacturer to get more accurate cost estimates.
    * Propose, select and refine (exterior/interior) materials and finish options
    * Coordinate with the various engineering disciplines

* **Phase 4 - Construction Documents**
*(approximate duration: 8 weeks;  Approximately 35 % of overall fee)*
    * We, along with our consultants, will draft and compose the following drawings for permit and construction:
        * Site Plans
	        * We are assuming the Civil Engineer will do the following drawings:

		        * Grading
		        * Utilities
		        * Erosion and Sedimentation Controls
        * Architectural

	        * Door/Window/Finish Schedule
        * Structural Plans
    * Continue to refine cost estimate.
    * Coordinate with the various engineering disciplines and consultants.

* **Phase 5 - Bidding and Construction Contract Negotiation**
*(approximate duration: 2 week;  Approximately 5 % of overall fee)*
    * Submit/manage any municipal plan reviews and/or permits.
    * Answer subcontractor's bid questions, issue clarifications.
    * Review bids.
    * Modify drawings, if over budget.
* **Phase 6 - Construction Administration**
*(Anticipated duration: n/a;  Approximately 20 % of overall fee)*
    * Weekly site visits
    * Respond to RFIs (request for information)
    * Review shop drawings and submittals
    * Review substitutions
    * Review change orders
    * Develop punch list
    * If applicable, review application for payments

As is typical with the initial phases of a building project, the design is often too nebulous to determine a realistic ‘lump-sum’ and/or not-to-exceed maximum fee.  In that light, we propose a two part fee contract whereby the first part will be a an hourly rate proposal for approximately a fifth (1/5th) of the project’s schedule--that is, the early programming and schematic design phases of the project (approx. 4 to 6 weeks).  For the second part, when the extent of the scope is better defined, we propose to continue with our hourly fees, but amend the contract by adding a not-to-exceed maximum fee.  This fee will be a fixed percentage of final construction costs.

Having said that however, to give Xcel ballpark figures, with this type of project under ‘normal/average’ professional services, maximum fees will most likely be around the following ranges.

* Architecture - 5% to 7% of final construction costs
* Engineering (Structural) - 1% to 1.5% of final construction costs.

*Percentages cited from [A Guide to Determining Appropriate Fees  for the Services of an Architect Consultants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf).  Estimated percentages do not include reimbursable expenses*

####Billing Rate Schedule		

|-|Architecture|Structural|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Level 1|$85/HR| $150/HR|
|Level 2| $60/HR| $80/HR|
|Level 3|    -  | $70/HR|
|Level 4|    -  |    -   |
|Level 5|    -  |    -   |
|Level 6|    -  |    -   |

Additionally, the following list of consultants may be required during this project.  Their associated billing rates would be accounted for in the overall not-to-exceed A/E fee.

* Building Envelope Specialist
* Building Performance and Energy Modeling
* Specification Writer
* Door Hardware Consultant
* Lighting Consultant

*Consultant expenses will include an additional 10% to cover in-house administration, handling, financing, and insurance costs.*
